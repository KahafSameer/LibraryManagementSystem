The project proposal outlines the development of an E-Commerce-Based Library Management System. The existing manual management process is inefficient, prone to errors, and lacks real-time updates, leading to stock shortages and financial losses. The proposed system aims to automate inventory updates, streamline order processing, and provide a seamless shopping experience. The system will feature a dashboard for store owners to manage products, monitor sales, and generate reports, as well as a user-friendly interface for customers to browse products, add to cart, and place orders. The project will utilize PHP, MySQLi, and HTML to deliver a responsive and efficient platform.
